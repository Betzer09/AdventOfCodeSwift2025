#### 1. Introduction
Welcome to my Swift-based solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a 25-day coding challenge featuring puzzles of increasing difficulty. 
This repository is my attempt to solve the challenges using Swift, with an emphasis on clean, efficient, and idiomatic code.


#### 2. Setup and Requirements
To run the solutions, youâ€™ll need:
* Xcode: Version 15.0 or later (compatible with Swift 5.9).
* macOS: Monterey or later.

#### 3. Challenge Structure
Each challenge is organized into its own folder, named DayXX, where XX is the day of the challenge. For example:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Day00/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day01.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ Day01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day02.swift
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ AdventOfCode2025Tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day00Tests.swift
â””â”€â”€ README.md
